# Logistics & Delivery Optimization for an E-Commerce Company

🛠 **Problem Statement**
A fast-growing e-commerce platform wants to optimize its delivery operations by analyzing time and distance metrics. 
The goal is to improve route efficiency, reduce delivery delays, and lower operational costs.

🔍 **Approach & Methodology**

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Processed raw logistics data for meaningful insights.
Statistical Analysis: Measured route efficiency across different transportation methods.
Predictive Modeling: Identified factors causing delivery delays and proposed improvements.

📈 **Insights & Observations**

The Western, Southern, and Northern corridors experience the highest delivery traffic.
The routing engine underestimates delivery time due to traffic and real-world delays.
Full Truck Load (FTL) shipments are more efficient than smaller carting methods.

✅ **Recommendations**

Improve route planning algorithms by integrating real-time traffic data.
Increase FTL shipments for long-distance orders to cut costs and reduce transit time.
Expand delivery hubs in underutilized regions to balance network efficiency.

🛠️ **Technologies Used**

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels) Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau) Feature Engineering & Statistical Analysis
